# ROS2
The my_robot packages are from my work on the following Udemy courses by Edouard Renard:

ROS2 For Beginners (ROS Foxy, Humble - 2023)
ROS2 for Beginners Level 2 - TF | URDF | RViz | Gazebo

The arm_robot packages are my experiments on ROS2 with the Arctos Robotics Robotic Arm that I'm doing for the Houston Robotics Group.
Here's the original repo: https://github.com/ArctosRobotics/ROS
